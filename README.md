# My Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my developer portfolio! This is where I showcase my projects and skills as a developer. In this README file, you'll find information about the purpose of this project, how to run it, and how to get in touch with me.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to showcase my skills as a developer and give potential employers or clients an idea of what I can do. This portfolio includes a list of my projects, the technologies I've used, and descriptions of what each project does.

## How to Run

This project is a static website, so all you need to do is clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in your web browser. You can also view this portfolio online at [mydomain.com](http://mydomain.com).

## Technologies Used

This project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I used Git and GitHub to manage version control and deploy the website.
